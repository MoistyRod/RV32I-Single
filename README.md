#Single-Cycle RISC-V RV32I CPU
For this project, I implement a simple single-cycle CPU based on the [RISC-V RV32I ISA](https://riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/riscv-spec-v2.2.pdf).
The CPU is designed with reference to the book "Digital Design and Computer Architecture".
It supports all unpriviledged instructions excluding FENCE(less relevant for single thread).
